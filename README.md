### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
1) Image loading, it's where we usually have performance issues.
2) UI Polish and code organization, looks are important

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
03/22 -> 30 min (Project setup, NetworkManager)
03/23 -> 30 min (Load UI)
03/24 -> 1h (Image Loader)
03/25 -> 2h (ViewModel, UI Polish, Tests)

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I had some time constraints so I decided to go with a simple app that could show off a few things -> 
Protocols, dependency injection, MVVM, Image loading, nice UI and testing

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Additional details/features

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
In the video I'm showing that the network call fails at the beginning and then it loads after pull to refresh - that was just to show different states handling, the submitted code works as expected.

Thanks for your consideration!
